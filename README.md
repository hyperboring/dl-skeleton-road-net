# Deep Learning-Based Learned Skeletonization of Road Networks

This project implements a deep learning approach to recover thin skeleton representations from thick, noisy road network images generated using OpenStreetMap data. It uses a U-Net architecture to predict one-pixel-wide road skeletons from rasterized road networks with varying thickness and distortions.
